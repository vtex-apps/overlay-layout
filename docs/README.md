# [DO NOT USE THIS] Popover Layout

This repository provides blocks that can help you create a Dropdown, Select or a Tooltip component.

## Configuration

1. Import the popover layout app to your theme's dependencies in the `manifest.json`, for example:

```jsonc
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vtex.popover-layout": "0.x"
  }
}
```

2. Now you can use the two blocks exported by `vtex.popover-layout`. Notice that you need to configure your own popover-layout and pass it as a child of popover-trigger.

```jsonc
{
  "popover-trigger": {
    "children": [
      "rich-text#question",
      "popover-layout"    
    ]
  },
  "rich-text#question": {
    "props": {
      "text": "**Click to open the popoer layout**",
      "blockClass": "question"
    }
  },
  "popover-layout": {
    "props": {
      "placement": "left"
    },
    "children": [
      "rich-text#link"
    ]
  },
  "rich-text#link": {
    "props": {
      "text": "\n**Reach us at**\nwww.vtex.com.br",
      "blockClass": "link"
    }
  }
}
```
